            <h3>A review of HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements that are enclosed by "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters</p>
            <p>The best part about HTML, is that once we know how to effectively use basic elements, we can look up how to use all of the others</p>

        <h4><u>Headings</u></h4>
        <h1>This is a size "1" heading</h1>
        <h2>This is a size "2" heading</h2>
        <h3>This is a size "3" heading</h3>
        <h4>This is a size "4" heading</h4>
        <h5>This is a size "5" heading</h5>
        <h6>This is a size "6" heading</h6>

        <h4><u>Lists</u></h4>
        <p>Below is an example of a nested-list, using both an ordered list and an unordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>Second</li>
            <li>Third</li>
            <ul>
                <li>3<sup>rd</sup> Place</li>
                <li>Tres</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Fourth</li>
        </ol>

        <h3><u>Links</u></h3>
        <p>Links are very useful, and help users to quickly navigate to new pages, both wihin and outside of the current website.</p>
        <p>For instance, they can quickly direct users to <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google's Homepage</a></p>
        <p><a href="mailto:portajuan484@gmail.com">Emails</a> can also be easily sent through the use of links.</p>
        <p><a href="#Top">They can even bring a user to a certain place within a webpage.</a></p>

        <h3><u>Images</u></h3>
        <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8d6baa_cdecf1a59f0c40eeab4681f58f6e3945~mv2.jpg" align="left" />
        <p>
            Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value of "left" is a perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right if the text by replacing the
            value in the "align" attribute to "right".
